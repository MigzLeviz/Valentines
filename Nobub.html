    <body>Hi bub this might seem very off, but within this letter you will see a part of as my appreciation to you, 
      whether you cannot decide to be with me or take this answer as a joke. I am glad that I could spend time with you on this, 
      maybe this will be just my best effort to give you my appreciation for being my first in everything.
      I always want to say that life has been rough for me, I have become more scared to lose you or even see someone else with you
      and I am a bit scared that I might not be able to provide my best that you want for a partner or even someone to take care for you.
      But no matter what, I am glad that you are doing great, my ultimate wish is always your happiness that shines greater than the full night sky.
      Honestly, writing this rn I still have insecurities but I am glad that I chose you as my first and ever first love of my life.
      I would wish lots of things from your career to become what you loved to be as a child, a Attorney for a company and someone so independent and strong
      that people love you for who you are, or even someone who gives you most amounts of effort and love that you wish for.
      If you ever meant this button as a joke, I am happy if you want to go back, but if not and you are hesitant about me and want to explore with someone else
      I would be gladly be watching you from a far and happy that you chose what is right and what you love to do. I love you always bub, I would never regret anything that
      I chose whenever it comes to you. Happy Valentines Bubby:>
